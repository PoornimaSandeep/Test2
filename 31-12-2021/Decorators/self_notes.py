decorators: Decorators allow us to wrap another function in order to extend the behaviour of the wrapped function,
            without permanently modifying it
            A function is an instance of the Object type.
            You can store the function in a variable.
            You can pass the function as a parameter to another function.
            You can return the function from a function.
            You can store them in data structures such as hash tables, lists, â€¦
