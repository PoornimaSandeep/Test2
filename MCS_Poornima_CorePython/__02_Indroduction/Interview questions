1.How interpreter works in python.
  1 .first its checks the syntax formation ,then its correst its convert that into byte code that will done by interpreter
  2.then the byte code will be send into PVM(python virtual machine) the byte code will execute if errors comes in logic its displaying error messsage otherwise its giving output

2.Python features
  1.Easy to learn
  2.Readable
  3.Interpreted language
  4.Object Oriented langauage
  5.Open source
  6.Large Standard library
  7.High level language
  8.Plantform independent
  9.GUI support

3.Interpreter CPython IronPython Jython
  cpython->cpython is popular implementation of python written in C, It can be better described as a mixture of both an interpreter and
           compiler as it converts written Python source code into bytecode.It is this bytecode that gets executed on the CPython Virtual Machine.
  jpython-jpython is popular implementation of python written in java and can run on java virtual machine

  IronPython -> IronPythoon is implementation of python that has been written in c sharp(c#) and we can run on the .net platform

 4.Procedure Oriented vs Object oriented programming languages

  Procedure Oriented                                                        oriented programming languages
  1.In procedural programming, program is divided                           1.In procedural programming, program is divided
    into small parts called functions.                                         into small parts called objects
  2.Procedural programming follows top down approach.	                    2.Object oriented programming follows
                                                                               bottom up approach.
  3.here is no access specifier in procedural programming.	                3.Object oriented programming have access specifiers
                                                                              like private, public, protected etc.
  4.In procedural programming, overloading is not possible.              	4.Overloading is possible in object oriented programming.
  5.In procedural programing ,function are more important than data           5.In OOP data is more important than function
